### CHAPTER 1 ### - Introducing the .NET platform

CLI = Common Language Infrastructure -> allows: cross-languge interoperability & enables to run code on various platforms (Mono on iOS)

.NET ASSEMBLIES
    Runtime institutes - containers for metadata - and basic unit of deployment
    Self-describing nature provided through the use of metadata
    The execution of assemblies immediately triggers CLR to provide the necessary runtime services for the app to run - DIFFERENT from the means to run
    native code

Common type system

CLS  = Common Language Specification -> Rule1 : CLS rules apply only to those parts of a type that are accesible or visible outside of the defining assembly
CLS-compliant libraries

IL Code - Intermediate Language - language-independent format

Application Domains

JIT compilation - just-in-time - Compiler responsible for making the mapping between IL code and native processor instructions "the jitter" (pag 41)


### CHAPTER 2 ### - Introducing the C# programming language

NUllable types: 
    int a = null;   //won't compile: a value type isn't nullable
    int? a = null;

Using local variable type inference
    Dictionary<string, List<PhoneNumber>> whitepages = new Dictionary<string, List<PhoneNumber>>();
    var whitepages = new Dictionary<string, List<PhoneNumber>>();

Anonymus types:
    var res =   from product in db.Products
                where product.Price > 100
                select new {product.Name, product.Price}

Initializer Expressions
    Product p =  new Product("chai");
    p.Price = 123.45m;
    becomes:
        Product p = new Product("chai"){ Price = 123.45m };
        int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 4, 7}

Extension Methods:
    we can allow a static method to be used as if it were an instance method
    string reverse = name.Reverse() -> public static string Reverse(THIS string s)
    instead of:
    string reverse = Helpers.Reverse(name)

    This is important: it allows FLUENT API: 
    string bar = "Bart"
    string art = bart.ToUpper().Trim().Substring(1);    //ART

Lambda Expressions:
    Funct<int, int, int> add20 = delegate(int a , int b) {return a+b; };
    Func<int, int, int> add30 = (a,b) => a+b;

Expression Trees:   pag 71
    A way to represent code as data that can be inspected at runtime
    Alternative to represent the Lambda expression to an expression tree:
    ExpressionFunc<int, int, int> add = (a,b) => a+b;

Reaching out to dynamic languages
    Type inference IS NOT dynamic typing:
    'var' just enables us to let the compiler figure out the type on our behalf (string s1 = "hi" is just like var s1 = "hi")

    dynamic keyword:
    EARLY-BOUND code:
    Calculator calculator = GetCalculatorFromSomewhere();
    int three = calculator.Add(1,2);

    LATE-BOUND code:
    dynamic calculator = GetCalculatorFromSomewhere();
    int three = calculator.Add(1,2)
    Now the compiler doesn't bother to find an Add method at compile time because it simply doesn't know what the type of the calculator will be.
    Instead of emitting IL code to call directly into a known early-bound method, it emits code to invoke the overload resolution at runtime.
    If a good match is found, the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) steps in to provide efficient site code generation so that subsequent
    calls do not suffer from overload resolution again. Runtime Exceptio otherwise
    Dynamic is very different from 'var'

Async programming:
    async void DownloadHtmlAsync(string url)
    {
        WebClient client = new WebClient();
        string html = await client.DownloadHtmlAsync(url);
        textBox.Text = html;
    }

Compiler as a service

### CHAPTER 3 ### - Getting started with .NET development using C#

Inspect the assembly: ILSpy http://www.ilspy.net 

Windows Presentation Foundation - uses XAML: a way to use XML to create object instances

Unit Testing: solution explorer-> Add New project to add a Unit Test Project -> add Reference to the project to be tested

### CHAPTER 4 ### - Language essentials

static int Main(string[] args)

Contextual Keywords:
    int value = discount.value; //value is a keywork in the property accessor context:
    public int Age
    {
        get {return _age; }
        set {_age = value}
    }

Constructors:  new keyword that acts like a factory producing a concrete object from a type (shape of obj)

Decimal type 
    decimal x = 0.12M   // or 0.12m

"Banning" System.Object for generics, System.Object's methods:
    -Equals
    -GetHashCode
    -ToString
    For dynamic typing we use 'dynamic' which can be seen as a System.Object with some meta-data to tell the compiler  
    to emit late-bound code and don't check the type at compile-time but at runtime.

CLS-compliant page 208
    [assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]
    in Properties-> Assemblyinfo.cs 

    IL directive dor declaration of local variables:
    .locals init ([0] int32 x)

The use of 'var'
    //Required
    var person = new {Name = 'Bart', Age = 26}
    var expensive = LINQ query

    //Good use
    var lotteryNumbers = new Dictionary<string, List<int>>
    var name = Person.ToString();

    //BAD
    var mystery = getSomething();

Documentation Comments: /// -> Build-> XML Documentation file

Arrays
    int[] squares = new [] {0,1,4,9}
    int[] squares = {0,1,4,9}
    var squares = new [] {0,1,4,9}

    byte[,] sudoku = new byte[9,9]

Nullable Value types
    Nullable<int> c = 42 equivalent to:     int? c = 42;
    double? number = getNumber();
    if(number.HasValue)
    {
        //do stuff
    }

    Nullable<T> provides a box around the original type with the HasValue and Value properties


### CHAPTER 5 ### - Expressions and Operators

Expression: sequence of operators and operands
ARITY: number of operands on which they operate.

IL directives:
    ldc loads a constant by pushing it onto the stack
    stloc pop the top value from the stack and stores it in a local variable slot 

Call stack and evaluation stack -  even though they together form the CLS stack

Overflow Checking
    checked
    {
        int max = int.MaxValue;
        int res = max + 1;
        //int res = checked(max+1)
        Console.WriteLine(res);
    }

String Concatenation
    string[] names = new[] {"bart", "john", "lisa" };

    var peopleList = new StringBuilder();
    foreach(string name in names)
    {
        peopleList.Append(name);
        peopleList.Append(", ");
    }
    string people = peopleList.ToString();

    OR: string people = string.Join(", ", names);

If the IL code doesn't look as optimized as I expect to: leave room for optimization to the JIT compiler
